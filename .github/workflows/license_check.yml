name: Check for forbidden licenses

# Checks for any forbidden/copyleft licenses using their SPDX identifiers
# (https://spdx.org/licenses/)

# To check Python packages, pip-licenses (https://github.com/raimon49/pip-licenses) is used to
# generate a listing of packages and their associated licenses.  This listing is checked against a
# regex in FORBIDDEN_LICENSE_CHECK to ensure no forbidden licenses are present.  If any are detected, the build is failed.  

# List of copyleft licenses derived from Blue Oak Council Guide to Copyleft
# (https://blueoakcouncil.org/copyleft)

# List of forbidden licenses derived from Google License Classifier
