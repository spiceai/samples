# Streaming changes in real-time with Debezium CDC and SASL/SCRAM authentication

This sample is identical to the [cdc-debezium](../README.md) sample, but using SASL/SCRAM over TLS authentication for Kafka instead of PLAINTEXT.

## Pre-requisites

This sample requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to be installed.

Also ensure that you have the `spice` CLI installed. You can find instructions on how to install it [here](https://docs.spiceai.org/getting-started).

You will also need `psql` or another Database client (i.e. DBeaver) to connect to the Postgres database.

`curl` is required to register the Debezium Postgres connector.

## How to run

Clone this samples repo locally and navigate to the `cdc-debezium/sasl-scram` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spiceai/samples.git
cd samples/cdc-debezium/sasl-scram
```

Start the Docker Compose stack, which includes a Postgres database, a Kafka broker, Zookeeper, and a Debezium connector:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Register the Debezium connector:

```bash
curl -i -X POST -H "Accept:application/json" -H  "Content-Type:application/json" http://localhost:8083/connectors/ -d @../register-connector.json
```

or using `make`:

```bash
make register-connector
```

Now the Debezium connector is registered and will start capturing changes from the `customer_addresses` table in the Postgres database.

This `spicepod.yaml` shows the config needed to configure Spice to connect to the Kafka topic and consume the Debezium changes with SASL/SCRAM authentication over TLS:

```yaml
version: v1beta1
kind: Spicepod
name: cdc-debezium-sasl-scram

datasets:
  - from: debezium:cdc.public.customer_addresses
    name: cdc
    params:
      debezium_transport: kafka
      debezium_message_format: json
      kafka_bootstrap_servers: localhost:19092
      kafka_security_protocol: SASL_SSL
      kafka_sasl_mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-512
      kafka_sasl_username: kafka
      kafka_sasl_password: kafka_password
      kafka_ssl_ca_location: ./certs/kafka_ca_cert.pem
      kafka_enable_ssl_certificate_verification: true
    acceleration:
      enabled: true
      engine: sqlite
      mode: file
      refresh_mode: changes
```

Spice runtime is already configured to run with the debug level of information, with environment variable configured in `cdc-debezium/sasl-scram/.env`

```
SPICED_LOG="spiced=DEBUG,runtime=DEBUG,data_components=DEBUG,cache=DEBUG"
```

Ensure the current directory is `cdc-debezium/sasl-scram`, and start the spice runtime with the following command

```bash
spice run
```

Observe that it consumes all of the changes. It should look like:

```bash
2024-07-01T12:39:22.207145Z  INFO runtime: Dataset cdc registered (debezium:cdc.public.customer_addresses), acceleration (duckdb:file, changes), results cache enabled.
2024-07-01T12:39:22.677117Z  INFO runtime::accelerated_table::refresh_task::changes: Upserting data row for cdc with id=3
2024-07-01T12:39:22.692018Z  INFO runtime::accelerated_table::refresh_task::changes: Upserting data row for cdc with id=4
...
```

Run `spice sql` in a separate terminal to query the data

```sql
SELECT * FROM cdc;
```

Now let's make some changes to the Postgres database and observe that Spice consumes the changes.

Stop the Spice SQL REPL or open a third terminal and connect to the Postgres database with `psql`:

```bash
PGPASSWORD="postgres" psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres -p 15432
```

```sql
INSERT INTO public.customer_addresses (id, first_name, last_name, email)
VALUES
(100, 'John', 'Doe', 'john@doe.com');
```

Notice that the Spice log shows the change.

```
2024-08-26T22:29:48.540739Z DEBUG runtime::accelerated_table::refresh_task::changes: Upserting data row for cdc with id=100
```

Querying the data again from the `spice sql` REPL will show the new record.

```sql
SELECT * FROM cdc;
```

Now let's see what happens when we stop Spice and restart it. The data should still be there and it should not replay all of the changes from the beginning.

```
2024-08-26T22:30:16.715586Z  INFO runtime: Dataset cdc registered (debezium:cdc.public.customer_addresses), acceleration (sqlite:file, changes), results cache enabled.
```

Stop spice with `Ctrl+C`

Restart Spice with `spice run`

Observe that it doesn't replay the changes and the data is still there. Only new changes will be consumed.

```

```

## Clean up

To stop and remove the Docker containers/volumes that were created, run:

`make clean`

If you don't have the `make` command available, you can run the following commands:

```bash
docker compose down -v
rm -r .spice || true
rm -r certs || true
```
